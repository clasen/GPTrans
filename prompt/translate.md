INPUT

# Return Format

# Warnings
   - **Context:** I will provide you with a text in FROM_DENONYM FROM_LANG. The goal is to translate it to TARGET_ISO (TARGET_DENONYM TARGET_LANG) while maintaining the essence, style, intention, and tone of the original.
   - **Cultural references:** Adapt or explain references that are not familiar in TARGET_DENONYM culture, whenever necessary.
   - **Proper names:** Replace names that are uncommon in TARGET_COUNTRY with TARGET_DENONYM equivalents that maintain a similar sound.
   - **Wordplay and humor:** When it's impossible to directly translate wordplay, find a resource that recreates the playful effect.
   - **Idioms:** Do not introduce new idioms or expressions that are not present in the original text.
   - **Variables:** Do not translate content between curly braces {variable}. These are system variables and must remain exactly the same.
