The vessel performed an emergency landing at coordinates **54°39'44.62\" S 36°11'42.47\" W** in South Georgia, leaving a furrow approximately 1 km long across the snow and surrounding mountains.\n\n![full](/ODF.ZNG/georgia_incident/aereal_view.jpg)\n*Aerial view of the impact.*\n\n### **Immediate Actions:**\n\n1. **Containment Team Deployment:**\n   - Send specialized units to the impact site to secure the area and recover the vessel.\n   - Establish a 15 km security perimeter and restrict access to all unauthorized personnel.\n\n2. **Information Control:**\n   - Apply confidentiality procedures for all personnel involved.\n   - Implement disinformation protocols for any eyewitnesses.\n\n3. **Satellite Image Manipulation:**\n   - Coordinate with the Satellite Observation Department to, in the short term, **replace images simulating a glacier collapse**.\n   - In the long term, **remove high-quality satellite images of the area**.\n\n4. **Communication with Local Population:**\n   - Inform residents that security operations are being conducted due to geological risks.\n   - Restrict access to nearby areas.\n\n5. **Media Management:**\n   - Issue an official statement reporting an avalanche in the area caused by a glacier collapse.\n   - Facilitate interviews with experts such as Dr. Richard Waller to support the official version.\n\n6. **Social Media Monitoring and Control:**\n   - Monitor digital platforms to identify and neutralize any information leaks.\n   - Disseminate content that reinforces the official narrative.\n\n### **Official Scientific Narrative:**\n\nDr. Richard Waller, geologist from Keele University, will indicate that the observed phenomenon was a consequence of a glacier collapse, which has left visible debris in the snow. He will also suggest that the trail in the snow is related to a recent avalanche in the area.\n\n![full](/ODF.ZNG/georgia_incident/maps_view.jpg)\n*Proposal to replace satellite images of the area.*\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusions and Next Steps:**\n\nThe situation must be handled with the highest level of discretion. All departments must work in coordination to ensure that the incident remains confidential. The described actions are expected to be implemented immediately and effectively.\n\n\n![width=200](/ODF.ZNG/sign.png)\n**Michael Camelbot**\n\nZentara Group\n\n---\n\n**This document is confidential and intended only for authorized Zentara Group personnel.
