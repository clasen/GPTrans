- **Caching with DeepBase:** Quickly retrieves cached translations to boost performance
- **Parameter Substitution:** Dynamically replace placeholders in your translations
- **Flexible Configuration:** Customize source and target locales, model keys, and batching settings to fit your needs

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
npm install gptrans
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```javascript
import GPTrans from 'gptrans';

const gptrans = new GPTrans({
  target: 'es-AR',
  from: 'en-US',
  model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'
});

// Translate text with parameter substitution
console.log(gptrans.t('Hello, {name}!', { name: 'John' }));

// Set context for gender-aware translations
console.log(gptrans.setContext('Message is for a woman').t('You are very good'));

// Other translation examples
console.log(gptrans.t('Withdraw'));
console.log(gptrans.t('Top-up'));
console.log(gptrans.t('Transfer'));
console.log(gptrans.t('Deposit'));
console.log(gptrans.t('Balance'));
console.log(gptrans.t('Transaction'));
console.log(gptrans.t('Account'));
console.log(gptrans.t('Card'));
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

When creating a new instance of Gptrans, you can customize:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `target` | Target language locale | `'en-US'` |
| `from` | Source language locale | `'es-AR'` |
| `model` | Translation model key | - |
| `batchThreshold` | Maximum number of characters to accumulate before triggering batch processing | `1000` |
| `debounceTimeout` | Time in milliseconds to wait before processing translations | `500` |

## üîç How It Works

1. **First-Time Translation Behavior:** On the first request, Gptrans will return the original text while processing the translation in the background. This ensures your application remains responsive without waiting for API calls.
2. **Translation Caching:** Once processed, translations are stored in `db/gptrans_<iso>.json`. Subsequent requests for the same text will be served instantly from the cache.
3. **Smart Batch Processing:** Translations are processed in batches, providing better context for more accurate results.
4. **Dynamic Model Integration:** Easily plug in multiple AI translation providers with the ModelMix library.
5. **Customizable Prompts:** Load and modify translation prompts (see the `prompt/translate.md` file) to fine-tune the translation output.
6. **Manual Corrections:** A JSON file stores key-translation pairs, allowing you to override specific translations and make manual corrections when needed. Simply edit the `db/gptrans_<iso>.json` file:

```json
{
{
    "balanc_pephba": "Saldo",
    "transa_m1wmv2": "Transacci√≥n",
    "accoun_rtvnkg": "Cuenta",
    "card_yis1pt": "Tarjeta",
    "hello_name_1vhllz3": "¬°Hola, {name}!",
    ...
}
```

## üåê Environment Setup

Gptrans uses dotenv for environment configuration. Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your API keys:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
```
